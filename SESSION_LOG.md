# CuffBot — Session Log

Append-only journal of work sessions, oldest first — **never rewrite or delete past entries**; they are the project's memory. Each session appends one entry at the bottom using this template:

```markdown
## Session <N> — <YYYY-MM-DD>

**Goal:** what this session set out to do, and why (roadmap item / user request / resume point).
**Done:** what actually got finished, with commit hashes.
**Decisions:** choices made and the reasoning — future sessions should not have to re-litigate them.
**Corrections:** drift found in Step 2 (claimed vs. actual), or `None — state matched reality.`
**Learned:** surprises worth remembering (also mirrored into skill LEARNINGS/references when general).
**Skill:** what changed in the skill this session (version), or why nothing needed to.
**Handoff:** exact next steps for Session <N+1> — mirror the essentials into STATE.md's resume point.
```

## Session 0 — 2026-07-23

**Goal:** Bootstrap the project from an empty repo, per the owner's brief: a **self-improving skill** that builds CuffBot, a police-themed Discord bot; everything in English; clear manuals per module; sessions that hand off seamlessly; verify instead of assume.

**Done:**
- Built the `run-skill-generator` skill v0.1.0: session loop (Orient → Verify → Plan → Build → Document → Record → Improve), iron rules, Definition of Done, references (`architecture.md`, `module-manual-template.md`, `discord-reference.md`, `self-improvement.md`), `CHANGELOG.md`, `LEARNINGS.md`, eval prompts.
- Built the state system: `CLAUDE.md`, `STATE.md` (with Verification block), this log, `ROADMAP.md` (M1–M8), `docs/README.md` manual index, `.gitignore`, root `README.md`.
- Validated the skill with isolated eval runs (bootstrap session and continuation-with-drift, each with and without the skill, graded against objective assertions); any findings are folded back into the skill — post-0.1.0 entries in its `CHANGELOG.md` carry the evidence.
- Commits: see `git log` for this session's history on the feature branch.

**Decisions:**
- Stack: discord.js v14 on Node 22, ESM, `node:test`, JSON storage first — see `architecture.md` for rationale. Environment verified, not assumed (Node v22.22.2 present; npm registry reachable, discord.js 14.27.0).
- Skill lives in-repo (`.claude/skills/`) so it travels with the code and every session gets it automatically via `CLAUDE.md`.
- Lessons flow through a two-stage pipeline (LEARNINGS candidates → promoted into the skill after second confirmation) to keep the skill lean.

**Corrections:** None — first session, nothing to drift from.

**Learned:** Environment facts recorded in `STATE.md` (npm works through proxy; ephemeral container; no `gh` CLI).

**Skill:** Created at 0.1.0; post-eval improvements recorded in its `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Handoff:** Session 1 picks up `STATE.md → Resume point`: Milestone M1, scaffold the bot core (package.json, entry, config/logger/loader, `core` module with `/radio-check`, tests, `.env.example`, `docs/modules/core.md`). Read `architecture.md` first.
